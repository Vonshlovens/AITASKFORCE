# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.

## Why MCP Matters

Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with various data sources and tools.

## Industry Adoption (2025 Updates)

- **OpenAI** officially adopted MCP in March 2025, integrating across [[ChatGPT and OpenAI Tools|ChatGPT]], Agents SDK, and Responses API
- **Google DeepMind** confirmed MCP support in upcoming [[Google Gemini|Gemini]] models in April 2025
- **Microsoft** partnered with Anthropic to create official C# SDK

## Available MCP Servers

Pre-built MCP servers are available for popular enterprise systems including:
- Google Drive
- Slack
- GitHub
- Git
- Postgres
- Puppeteer

## Technical Implementation

### Getting Started with MCP

1. **Choose compatible AI tools** - Start with [[Claude and Anthropic|Claude]] or [[ChatGPT and OpenAI Tools|ChatGPT]] with MCP support
2. **Install MCP servers** - Use pre-built servers or develop custom ones
3. **Configure connections** - Set up authentication and permissions
4. **Test integrations** - Verify data flow and functionality

### Custom MCP Development

For organizations with specific needs, custom MCP servers can be developed to connect AI assistants to proprietary systems and databases.

## Benefits for Enterprise

- **Standardization** - One protocol for all AI-data connections
- **Scalability** - Add new data sources without custom implementations
- **Future-proofing** - Compatible with multiple AI models and platforms
- **Security** - Centralized authentication and permission management
