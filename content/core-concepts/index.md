# Core Concepts - Working Effectively with AI

**Target Audience:** Users with basic AI exposure  
**Learning Objective:** Understanding how to work effectively with AI

## The Meta-Prompting Strategy

### Why Multi-Step Processes Matter

Multi-step process is important when working with LLMs - build up the context, make corrections, etc.

The most effective AI users don't try to solve everything in one prompt. Instead:

1. **Plan First** - Use AI to generate a strategy or outline
2. **Iterate** - Build on responses, make corrections
3. **Implement** - Use specialized tools ([[Cursor and Windsurf|coding agents]], [[Building AI-Powered Workflows|workflow builders]]) for execution

## Understanding Context Limitations

### The Performance Curve

While AI models can technically handle 200K+ tokens (150K+ words), the performance can start breaking down much earlier than that, maybe around 10k or so tokens, or 7500 words.

### Strategies for Large Projects

- Break complex problems into smaller pieces
- Use multiple AI conversations for different aspects
- Leverage [[Building AI-Powered Workflows|workflow automation]] for sequential processing
- Consider using specialized [[Cursor and Windsurf|coding agents]] for large codebases

## When to Start Fresh

Sometimes the model gets something wrong, and it is very difficult for it to let go of incorrect beliefs which can keep you stuck in a problem. In these cases, it is definitely time to start a new chat (clear the context).

### Signs You Need a Fresh Start

- AI keeps making the same mistake despite corrections
- Conversation has become too long and unfocused
- You need to pivot to a completely different approach
- Performance seems to be declining

## Choosing the Right Model for the Task

### Quick Reference Guide

| Task Type | Best Models | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Complex reasoning, planning | [[ChatGPT and OpenAI Tools|OpenAI o3, o4-mini]] | Extended thinking capabilities |
| Fast information retrieval | [[Claude and Anthropic|Claude 4.1]] | Precise instruction following |
| Coding projects | [[Claude and Anthropic|Claude Opus 4]] | Specialized for development |
| Research & YouTube analysis | [[Google Gemini|Gemini 2.5 Pro]] | Strong search integration |
