# Getting Started with AI Tools

**Target Audience:** Complete beginners to AI tools  
**Learning Objective:** Understanding basic concepts and getting first AI experience

## What is AI and Why Should You Care?

### The AI Revolution in 2025

Artificial Intelligence has moved from science fiction to daily reality. As of 2025, AI assistants can now use tools, search the web, analyze data, reason through complex problems, and even generate imagesâ€”all while maintaining extended conversations and learning from context.

### Key Concepts to Understand

**[[Large Language Models (LLMs)]]** - Think of these as incredibly sophisticated autocomplete systems that understand context, reasoning, and can generate human-like responses.

**[[Tokens]]** - The building blocks of AI communication. A million input tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words, a bit longer than "War and Peace." Understanding tokens helps you work within AI system limits.

**[[Context Window]]** - How much information an AI can remember in a single conversation. Modern AI models typically handle 128K-200K tokens, with some reaching over 1 million tokens.

**[[Modalities]]** - Types of data AI can process:
- **Text** (words, code, documents)
- **Images** (photos, diagrams, screenshots) 
- **Audio** (voice, music)
- **Video** (combining images and audio)

## Your First AI Experience
